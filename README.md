# Welcome!👋

## ✍️ Hi, I’m @AmilkarAlan

This is my GitHub where I keep the projects I'm doing throughout my apprenticeship.

## 🚀 I'm starting a new adventure ...

It starts in the FrontEnd developer career ...

I studied and finished my accounting degree, but I did not receive my degree.
I realized that it wasn't what made me happy, it wasn't even entertaining. In fact, I could say that i hates it.

I made peace with myself and decided to learn and dedicate myself to what I have always liked, which is programming.

## 🧠 I’m currently learning ...

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JS
  - ReactJs
  - ExpressJs
  - Markdown
  - Git


## 👁️ I'm looking for...


I am looking to continue my learning.
For this reason, comments, tips or help are welcome. That would help me a lot to continue growing in this new 🌎 world that I am about to enter.
I am also looking to start working and collaborating. 🧰 A job where I can start and put my skills into practice 🤓.
